# Machine Learning Scripts and Notebooks

This is a repository containing various machine learning related scripts, notebooks, and mini projects.

The examples in this repo will be using PyTorch as the ML framework.

## Todo
- [ ] Implement data augmentation auto passing (automatically apply augmentations and append new tensors to data list)
- [ ] Implement 'reverse' augmentation, reverses order of inputted tensor
- [ ] Implement data shuffling, as currently data is in order it was inputted
- [ ] Actually learn to use PyTorch properly??? :thinking:
